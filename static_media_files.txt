##### HANDLING STATIC AND MEDIA FILE IN DJANGO #####
1. Perform the following settings in your 'settings.py'
  # Static files i.e css,javascript, images
  import os
  STATIC_URL = '/static/'
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static_files')
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]

  # Media files i.e Uploaded files by users
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media_files")

2. Configure your 'urls.py'
  from django.conf import settings 
  from django.conf.urls.static import static
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path 

  urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # other url patterns
  ]

  # Serve static and media files during development 
  if settings.DEBUG == True:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

3. Collect Static Files
  ~ python manage.py collectstatic
  - The above command will copy all static files from your app and store them in the provided STATIC_ROOT

NOTE: The settings above only work when running Django during development. In production, configure your web server to serve these files.

4. USING THE STATIC FILES IN YOUR TEMPLATES 
  * assuming you have a css file called 'styles.css'
  * the folder structure for this css file is:
      myproject/blogapp/static/styles.css
  * to use this file in a template i.e 'index.html'
  * the folder structure for this html file is:
      myproject/blogapp/templates/index.html
  * add {% load static %} to the top of the template file
  * for each file you would like to link, add the {% static %} template tag
    ~ index.html
    {% load static %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'base.css' %}">

  * or if you want to load a javascript file:
    <script src="{% static 'your_javascript_file' %}"></script>



#### FURTHER EXPLANATION ######
* in each app inside your project, Django automatically look for a folder named 'static' for the static files.
* tell Django to look for static files in additional locations by defining STATICFILES_DIRS in settings.py
