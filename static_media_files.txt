##### HANDLING STATIC AND MEDIA FILE IN DJANGO #####
1. Perform the following settings in your 'settings.py'
  # Static files i.e css,javascript, images
  STATIC_URL = '/static/'
  STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR, 'static_files'
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]

  # Media files i.e Uploaded files by users
  MEDIA_URL = '/media'
  MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media_files"

2. Configure your 'urls.py'
  from django.conf import settings 
  from django.conf.urls.static import static
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path 

  urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # other url patterns
  ]

  # Serve static and media files during development 
  if settings.DEBUG == True:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

3. Collect Static Files
  ~ python manage.py collectstatic
  - the above command will copy all static files from your app

NOTE: the settings above only work when running Django during development. In production, configure your web server to serve these files.
